# slack-cli-reflection
A reflection project on Slack CLI that includes comprehension questions and peer review

## At a Glance

- Individual reflection
- Peer review
- Due before class Monday, *March 30*

## Introduction

Slack CLI was a challenging project! It's worthwhile to spend some time iterating on what you've learned.

You'll start with individual reflection on the API and Request & Response Cycle content we learned in Slack CLI.

Optionally, spend no more than 3 hours and no more than 50 lines of code to work on your Slack CLI project.

Lastly, you will peer review someone's Slack CLI project. In return, they will peer review yours!

## Timing

Because there is pair coordination that needs to happen, we ask that:

- Pairs coordinate early about when they will review each other's Slack CLI projects
- Individuals complete their individual reflection before Wednesday of Break Week
- Reviewers complete their review before Break Week ends

## Requirements

1. Fork this repo
1. Add your reviewer to your repo as a collaborator
1. Clone your fork of `slack-cli-reflection`
1. Answer the questions and follow the prompts described in the [Individual Reflection File](individual-reflection.md). Make sure you commit and push your answers to GitHub.
1. Coordinate with your pair to help them review your Slack CLI project by following the [Slack CLI Peer Review instructions](peer-review-instructions.md).
1. Coordinate with your pair to review their Slack CLI project by following the Peer Review instructions on their fork of the `slack-cli-reflection` project.
1. Submit a Pull Request at the end of this, before the due date.

## Summary

At the end of this lesson, we should have reviewed material on APIs and the Request & Response cycle, gotten feedback on the Slack CLI project, and given feedback on the Slack CLI project.
